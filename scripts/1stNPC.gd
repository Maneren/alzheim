const text = "Oh be praised, hero! You drove the beast away! Well, I didn't see the fight, but it must be that way because you are here and the dragon is not. And I also must say, you look kinda lost, are you okay? It must be the fight he gave you! Anyway, can you tell me your name so I can tell people about your doings!...\nâ€¦Okay, I'm gonna take it as you don't have a name or you don't just don't remember it. Why would you? It's just your name.\nBut still, lands of Alzheim need heroes like you! And I hope you keep up the good work and you gonna help the folks around. And maybe someday you gonna get rid of us that Black Sorcerer. Wait, you don't know him? The prophecy?\nIt says that one day a hero like you is gonna get rid of him. But first, you need to find the lost strings of the magic mandolin. You can get those from bards. Each region has one. Weird guys those bards. They are going into the big towns only when they need to make some money, so If you gonna look for them, just pick a road and soon or later you gonna bump into them. When the mandolin is fixed you need to play on it in the middle of the night in front of the evildoer's lair. Only then does he open the sealed door and can challenge the Black Sorcerer himself.\nWell, I'm not gonna take your time any further, there is help that needs to be done!\n"
